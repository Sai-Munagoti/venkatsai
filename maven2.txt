     Interview Question :-
    =====================
          -> what is .M2 ?
           a) .M2 is local repository of appache maven 
             * local repository is a .M2 where depencyies plugins are stored 

 Note :- 
======
     Appache maven has an advantage that is when we run any of three life cycle phases which will also include previous life cycle phases as well

      Ex:- If we learn mvn package <which is 4th phase > , which will also we run the previous phases <validate, compile , test >
