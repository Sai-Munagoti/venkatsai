  Configuration :-
=================


       Things to keep in mind before changing configurational changes
  
       1) where to change 
       2) Backup 
       3) How to change 
       4) Try in local environment 
       5) Documentation


   Snapshot / Backup :-
  ====================

   For wildfly ---configuration ---->home folderof wildfly  ----->Standalone---> configuration --->standalone _xml_history

Ex: for example we can take a if any corrputed in that case we can take snapshot on previous which is running in that place outside as a same name and we can start server
    

Different status of the artifacts deployed in widfly ?

:- In the wildfly deployed artifacts can have various status stateincluding the deployed

 * Deployed :- The appicatiom is sucessfully running onthe wlidfly server and accesible to user
 * Undeployed :- The application has been removed from the server and is hot currently running
 * Failed :-   The deployement process encountered as error and the application is not running 
 * Disable:-  The applicvation is intentionally stopped by adminstator and cannot be accessed until enabled 
 * Suspended:- The application is temporrily pause and can be resumed later
 * Redeploying :- The application is currently being updatd with new code is not fully avabile while the redeployment process is going 

Accessing deployment status:-

 --> Wildfly management console :-
 ------------------------------
  You can view the status of deployed artifacts through the wildfly admin console , which provides a list of deployments with their current state.

CL (command line interface) :-
-------------------------
           Using the wildfly commmand line interface you can query the status of deployment with managements commands.

Note :- 
---
    Indicating whether the application is currently running not deployed encountered n error during deployment intentionally deactivated temporaly paused or is in the process
   of being re - deployed with updates.


 Domain controller and host controller in the wild fly :-
----------------------------------------------------
 
* In jboss wildfly a domain controller is the centeral management point for the group of the server within a domain reposible for maintaining the overall configuration andpolicy 
 * While a host controller is a seperate process running on each server within the domain communating with domain controller to manage the individual server instances on that host machine.

Essentially the domain controller dicates the overall configuration , and the host controllers execute those configurations on their respectives server.

Key points:-
--------
aout domain and host controller
  
 * Domain controller :-
---------------------
  
 -> Acts as the centeral management point for the entire domain 
 -> Stores the domain - wide configuration in a file called "diomain.xml"
           {Home folder ---> Diomain------> configuration -----> Domain .xml}
-> Responsible for distrubing cofiguration changes to all host controllers within the domain 

* Host Controller:- 
------------------

->  manages the application server instances running on asepicfic host 
-> Reads its configured from a "host .xml" file spefic to that host   { home folder ----> Domain -----> configuration ....> host .xml }
 -> Communicate with the domai  comtroller to recive configuration updates and start /stop server instance
